# Task Buddy Privacy Policy

*Last updated: December 13, 2025*

## Overview

Task Buddy is designed with your privacy in mind. Your task data remains private and under your control.

## Data Storage

All your tasks, tags, and settings are stored locally on your device and in your personal iCloud account (if enabled). Your data is synced directly between your devices using Apple's iCloud service. We do not have access to your iCloud data.

## Analytics

We collect anonymous usage data to improve Task Buddy. This includes:
- App usage events (e.g., app opens, tasks created/completed, onboarding completion, widget interactions)
- Timestamps
- App version
- Task metadata (whether a task has a description, target date, or tag — not the actual content)

This data is completely anonymous and cannot be used to identify you. We do **not** collect:
- Personal information
- Task titles, descriptions, or content
- Tag names
- iCloud account details
- Device identifiers

Analytics data is stored securely in Apple's CloudKit infrastructure.

## iCloud Sync

If you enable iCloud sync, your data is stored in your private iCloud container. This data is:
- Encrypted by Apple
- Accessible only to you
- Not visible to us or any third party

## Third-Party Services

Task Buddy does not integrate with any third-party analytics platforms, advertising networks, or tracking services.

## Children's Privacy

Task Buddy does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
